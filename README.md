# Savor
*A modern discovery tool for restaurants—spotlighting local gems, family-owned spots, and community-serving establishments.*

Savor helps diners find places that matter to their community. We rank restaurants using a **Local Score** (community impact, ownership, reviews, and proximity) and highlight **family-owned** and **community-serving** businesses first.
